All children: It happened this morning.
Six of us were walking together to school
Lila
Ali
Bella
Momo
Tabi
Elsa
Momo and Bella... Always ahead.
Ali, always daydreaming
Tabi and Lila, hand in hand
And the last one, Elsa.

Boys : The quiet road of dark stones was shining under the fierce October sun.

Girls : The air was still brisk from the night

Momo : Look, have you seen it?

All : Momo was the first to see it, as usual.

Boys : Around the Peace square a lot of men were planting pickets
/Many, too many of them?/

Girls :  From the right, until our sight stops to the left, until the horizon.

All : They were instaling strange cameras.
On strange tripods.

Momo : They were not cameras but /surveyor's compass?/
They are taking measurments. 
Look, it's huge, it's big! It surely is a Soccer Stadium !

All : The biggest stadium of the world!

Momo : The construction crossed the square and it kept going.
Sir... Sir...

All : Momo was curious. He moved closed, asking again

Momo : Sir... Sir...
Are you building a Stadium Sir ?

All :  He got answer in an unknown language that nobody understood.
But the gesture that followed was clear enough.

Girls : Momo was polite.

Boys : This wasn't our place.

All : When adults work...

Momo : Imagine the size...
All the teams will play at the same time. We won't know who to look at !
Ten balls, twenty balls... All the city will be able to fit! And the next city, and the next
No one will have to watch the TV anymore !

All :  When we get to school, everyone knew something was being built .

Momo : A stadium, I am telling you it's a stadium !

Girls : Boys believed him...

Boys : Girls were raising their shoulders.

All : The bell rings and we forget.

Momo :  I've dreamt of the stadium all day...

All : So much so, that he had to stay after the class to finish his work.

Momo :  Alone in the class, in front of my Geography homework, I was happy.
