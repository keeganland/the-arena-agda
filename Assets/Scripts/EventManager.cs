/* This script has the major advantage of decreasing dependencies but the major disadvantage of it becoming hard to keep track of
 * what "events" actually exist. I don't think visual studio has any feature that will make this easier - but look into it. 
 * Events correspond to keys. Therefore I'm going to keep here a record of what keys are used for the dictionary and where:
 * VictoryReferee.cs
 *  "victory"
 *  "bossDied"
 * HealthController.cs
 *  "bossDied"
 *  "checkVictory"
 *  "resetPlayer"
 *  
 * This list is far from finished, unforunately. 
 * 
 *  //Keegan note 2018/7/1: searching for alex's enterArena calls
 * StartFirstBattle.cs
 *  "enterArena"
 * StopMoving.cs  //has all events to make any player stop moving separatly, together, and set "InCombat" bool.
 *  "StopMoving" (for both characters)
 *  "StartMoving" (for both characters)
 *  "StopBoyMoving" 
 *  "StartBoyMoving" 
 *  "StopGirlMoving"
 *  "StartGirlMoving"
 *  "NotInCombat" (They are not in combat : for city, exploration mode (boy follow girl))
 *  "InCombat"
 *
 * BetterPlayer_Movement.cs
 *  "stopForTextbox"
 *  "resumeAfterTextbox"
 *
 * BetterCameraFollow.cs
 *   "camTargetRefresh"    
 *
 * PublicVariableHolderneverUnload.cs
 *  "HideUI"
 *  "ShowUI"
